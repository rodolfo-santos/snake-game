This will start the game server on port 3000. 2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction: up arrow (↑) to move up, down arrow (↓) to move down, left arrow (←) to move left, and right arrow (→) to move right. 3. The goal is to eat apples to increase your score and the snake's length. Avoid colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's body, as it will result in game over. 4. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
